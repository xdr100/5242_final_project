# 5242 Fianl Project (Project 4: the Neural Style Transfer)

This project studies the application of Neural Style Transfer, focusing on the synthesis of a style
from one image and a content of another image. A pre-trained VGG network is utilized to
perform the content extraction and style extraction for images. This is followed by an optimization
procedure generating an image that combines the content and the style from two given images. In
our experiment with selected content images and style images, we plan to investigate the effect of
the hyperparameters, especially the ratio of content and style weight in the loss function, on the
performance. We will also discuss the usage of this model in practice, attempting to determine the
empirical conditions under which the method works and does not work.

The images used in the experiment are available in Gallery.
